		<p>Thank you for your participation in our study!  Your anonymous data makes an
		important contribution to our understanding of human learning and behavior. </p>

		<p>During this study, we are looking to understand how people learn to cooperate 
		with one another. Previous research has shown that people working together tend 
		to calibrate their behavior to match their partner's. Our experiment hopes to answer
		whether this calibration can occur even for <i>perceptual</i> or <i>low-level sensory</i>
		behaviors. In other words, we want to see whether you and your partner tended to
		become more similar and more accurate in your estimations of line lengths during
		the course of the experiment.</p>
		
		<p>If you have any questions about this research, you may contact the
		researcher, Dr. Alexandra Paxton at <a href = "mailto:paxton.alexandra@berkeley.edu" target="_blank">paxton.alexandra@berkeley.edu</a>.</p>
