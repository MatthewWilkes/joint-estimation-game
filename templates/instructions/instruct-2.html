                <p>Your goal is to remember and correctly estimate the length of a line. In the first half of the game, you will receive training. On each round, a line will appear for 1 second and then disappear. Two seconds later, you will be asked to recreate the line as accurately as possible. Move the mouse up and down to adjust the size of the red bar, and then click to enter your response.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-4">
                <p>During training, a grey bar will appear next to it for one second to show you the correct answer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-xs-4">
                <p>After another 2 seconds, you will have 2 options. First, you can choose to change your previous response to make it more accurate. Second, you can accept your first response as correct. If you choose to edit your response, you can repeat this process until you have settled on your answer. In the game, you will earn a bonus for accuracy, not speed. However, you must submit each guess within XXX seconds, or your game will time out. If this happens, your participation will end, and you will earn only the base HIT rate.</p>
