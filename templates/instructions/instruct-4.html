        <p>During the game, you will have the opportunity to earn two bonuses during each round:

        <ul>
            <li><b>Accuracy bonus</b>. You will earn a bonus for submitting more accurate guesses. You can earn a bonus of up to $XX.XX per round. (You will earn a greater percentage of that bonus for greater accuracy.)</li>
            <li><b>Round completion bonus</b>. You will also earn a flat bonus of $XX.XX per completed round, regardless of accuracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Remember</b>: You must submit each guess within XXX seconds. If you have not entered your response within that time, your game will time out, and you will only earn the base compensation rate for participation. You will not retain any of the bonuses from any rounds that you have already completed.</p>

        <p>If your partner times out, you will earn the base compensation rate for participation and bonuses that you have already earned.</p>
