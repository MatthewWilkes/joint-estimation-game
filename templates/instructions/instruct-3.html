              <p>Once you've finished the training rounds, you will play the game with a partner who has also finished training. Again, your goal is to submit the most accurate guess possible.</p>

              <p>At the beginning of each round, you and your partner will be shown a red line. It will appear for 1 second and then disappear.</p>

              <p><img src = "/static/images/red_stimulus_bar.png" width = 200px alt = "The stimulus will always be shown in red.">​</p>

            <div class="col-xs-4">

                <p>After waiting for 2 seconds, you will have 2 seconds to make your first guess individually. Again, move the mouse left and right to adjust the size of the blue bar, and then click to enter your response.</p>

                <p>After you and your partner have submitted your first guess, you will see your guess (in blue) above your partner's guess (in green).</p>

                <p><img src = "/static/images/blue_response_bar.png" width = 200px alt = "Your guess will always be shown in blue.">​

            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-4">

                <p>You and your partner will not be able to see the correct answer, but each of you can decide whether to accept your guess or submit a new guess. If either of you submits a new guess, you will both be asked to decide again to accept your guess or submit a new one.</p>

                <p>You and your partner will repeat this until you both decide not to make any additional changes and submit your final guesses.</p>

                <p>After you finish each round, you and your partner will move onto the next round.</p>
