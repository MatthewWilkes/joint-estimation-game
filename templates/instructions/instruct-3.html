        <p>In the second half of the game, you will be tested. You will now be working with a partner who has also finished training. Each of you will see the line at the same time and will make your first guess.</p>

        <p>After each of you has submitted your guess, you will both be shown your guess and your partner's guess.  You will not be able to see the correct answer, but each of you can decide whether to (1) accept your partner's guess, (2) accept your guess, or (3) submit a new guess. You and your partner will repeat this until you both agree on a guess to submit. After you finish each trial, you and your partner will move onto the next trial.</p>

        <p>During the game, you will have the opportunity to earn two bonuses during each trial:

        <ul>
            <li>You can earn a bonus for accuracy, earning up to $XX.XX per trial.  (You will earn a greater percentage of that bonus for greater accuracy.)</li>
            <li>You will also earn a flat bonus of $XX.XX per completed trial, regardless of accuracy.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Remember</b>:  You will not earn any bonus for faster performance, but you must submit each guess within XXX seconds.  If you have not entered your response within that time, your game will time out, and you will only earn the base compensation rate for participation.  You will not retain any of the bonuses from any trials that you have already completed.</p>
